## Skills Showcased

- **⚙️ Data Transformation (ETL) with Power Query:** Cleaned, shaped, and prepared the raw data for analysis by handling blanks, changing data types, and creating new columns.

- **🧮 Implicit Measures:** Formulated measures to derive key insights and KPIs like `Median Yearly Salary` and `Job Count`.

- **📊 Core Charts:** Utilized **Column, Bar, Line,** and **Area Charts** to compare job counts and track trends over time.

- **🌍 Geospatial Analysis:** Leveraged **Map Charts** to visualize the global distribution of jobs.

- **📋 KPI Indicators & Tables:** Used **Cards** to display key metrics and **Tables** to provide granular, sortable data.

- **🎨 Dashboard Design:** Designed an intuitive and visually appealing layout, exploring both common and uncommon chart types to best tell the data story.

- **🧩 Interactive Reporting:**
  - **Slicers:** Dynamically filtered the report by Job Title.
  - **Buttons & Bookmarks:** Created a seamless navigation experience.
